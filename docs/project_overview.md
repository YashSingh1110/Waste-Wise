## Project Overview

Waste-Wise is a hardware-based smart waste monitoring project developed using Arduino.
A physical dustbin model was built to indicate waste levels in three stages: Low, Medium,
and Full using LED indicators.

The project focuses on real-time waste level detection using an ultrasonic sensor.
Web-based monitoring was planned for future enhancement but was not implemented
as part of the current scope.
