# Waste-Wise 
Arduino-Based Smart Waste Monitoring Bin

## Overview
Waste-Wise is a hardware-based smart waste monitoring system developed using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. The project focuses on indicating the fill level of a dustbin in three stages: Low, Medium, and Full, using LED indicators.

## Problem Statement
Manual monitoring of dustbins is inefficient and can lead to overflow or delayed collection, causing hygiene issues.

## Solution
A physical smart bin was designed that:
- Measures the waste level using an ultrasonic sensor
- Displays the fill status using three LED indicators
- Provides a foundation for future web or IoT integration

## Working
- Ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between the sensor and waste level
- Based on distance values, LEDs indicate:
  - Low level
  - Medium level
  - Full level

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- LEDs (3-level indication)
- Resistors, jumper wires
- Physical dustbin model

## Future Scope
- Integration with a website or dashboard
- Cloud-based monitoring
- Notification system for waste collection
